Description: An app that lets the users provide the origin co-ordinates of geometrical shapes such as
squares and rectangles, their dimensions, and their colors, and the app produces an image file canvas with all
the geometrical shapes drawn in it but if the dimensions given exceed the dimensions of the canvas, then that shape will
not be part of the output.
